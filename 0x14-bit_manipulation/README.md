This is my README.md for Bit Manipulation in C.

This project I will be working with bits in C.

It includes functions to convert a binary number to an unsigned int, print the binary representation of a number, get the value of a bit at a given index, set the value of a bit to 1 at a given index, clear the value of a bit to 0 at a given index, and return the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.

## Functions

The following functions are provided by this library:

* `binary_to_uint()`: Converts a binary number to an unsigned int.
* `print_binary()`: Prints the binary representation of a number.
* `get_bit()`: Returns the value of a bit at a given index.
* `set_bit()`: Sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.
* `clear_bit()`: Sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.
* `flip_bits()`: Returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.
